transparent SOCKSv5 support
IPv6? not yet, but make it easy to add later

CLIENT FRAME
	Client creates input command
		has access to keystates -> create trinary move[3], buttons
	delta encode input command
	add to output batch
		pumped at end of each frame if criteria is met
		might buffer multiple commands into a packet, reduce udp overhead?
		i recall carmack saying this is not necessary, especially today

enum buttons_e {
	BUTTON_ATTACK,
	BUTTON_ALT_ATTACK,
	BUTTON_USE,
	// ...?!
}

struct inputCommand_t {
	byte		buttons; // not keystates, hand-crafted buttons
	vector3		angles; // or use shorts like iD Tech 3
	byte		move[3]; // -1, 0, 1 movement in each axis
}
